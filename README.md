🛠️ Dart Utility Application

A simple yet powerful Dart program that demonstrates core programming concepts — including String Manipulation, Collections, File Handling, and Date & Time operations.

This project combines these features into a small, interactive utility app that takes user input, processes it, and logs the results with timestamps.

🚀 Features

🔤 String Manipulation
Perform concatenation, interpolation, substring extraction, case conversion, reversal, and length counting.

📦 Collections
Store data using Lists, Sets, and Maps to show their unique behaviors.

📂 File Handling
Read and write data to files while managing errors safely.

⏰ Date & Time
Use Dart’s DateTime class to format, calculate, and log timestamps.

🧩 Integrated Utility App
Combines all the above features into one cohesive application.

⚙️ How to Run

Make sure you have Dart SDK installed.
👉 Install Dart
